It’s about who you know, the networks you’re part of, and how those connections can open doors—or close them. And just like income inequality, social capital isn’t evenly distributed. In some counties, cross-class friendships and civic engagement are strong; in others, networks remain fragmented and insular."

Inspired by researchers at Meta, Harvard, NYU, and Stanford, we explored these questions using data from the Social Capital Atlas. This dataset, which maps social connections among Facebook users aged 25 to 44 living in the United States, gives us the opportunity to uncover insights across counties, ZIP codes, high schools, and colleges."

Urban centers and regions with diverse economic opportunities tend to show higher scores, while rural areas and some economically isolated regions fall behind. This variation highlights uneven opportunities for forming cross-class friendships, a factor closely tied to upward mobility. Darker hues in the South and Southwest emphasize fragmented networks in these areas, shaped by systemic challenges like residential segregation and economic inequality."

Here, each unit within the bubbles represents 100k people. At first glance, no new immediate patterns emerge, so let’s switch to the exposure metric for low-SES individuals—how often they interact with high-SES peers in shared settings—to explore these dynamics. Bright regions in the Midwest and central-west suggest that shared spaces like workplaces may blur socioeconomic lines, fostering these interactions. Conversely, dimmer shades in the South and rural areas underscore the isolation of low-SES individuals, limiting access to high-SES networks and, consequently, economic opportunity."

In contrast, rural areas remain dim, highlighting fewer opportunities for high-SES individuals to interact, even with peers of similar socioeconomic status."

Notably, Eastern and South Eastern regions tend to have larger clustering measures."

Bright pockets in the Midwest and coastal areas highlight active community involvement, sometimes independent of clustering. Urban areas with low clustering but high volunteering suggest engagement driven by shared missions rather than close personal ties. However, we find notably low volunteering rates as state aggregates amongst the South, where systemic challenges, economic disparities, and lower access to resources may hinder civic participation."

Interestingly, for low-SES individuals the Midwest reveals pockets of low or even negative bias, indicating areas where cross-class friendships exceed expectations based on exposure. However, much of the U.S. map falls within a relatively narrow range of friendly bias, from -0.02 to 0.16, distributed uniformly across various regions. This uniformity suggests a broad but modest variation in the extent to which shared spaces lead to meaningful social integration. A few counties stick out like Todd, SD, DeSoto, FL and Corson, SD as exhibiting particularly high bias."

In densely packed urban and suburban areas, bias tends to hover closer to 0, reflecting slightly more balanced opportunities for interaction within socioeconomic groups. However, regions in the South, particularly concentrated around Georgia, stand out with notably low bias, highlighting areas where high-SES individuals are more integrated into their communities, although within limited socioeconomic spheres."

We see a clear positive trend along the diagonal of 1:1 mappings and see how parental SES influences students’ SES. We find many points close to the diagonal, however some points reoccur in similar places more than once across categories. For example, let’s keep an eye on Veterans HS (1.12 Own SES, 1.43 Parent SES) at the top center and Fatima HS (1.6 Own SES, 0.55 Parent SES) at the bottom center as we explore these plots. More generally, larger bubbles above the diagonal are fostering upward mobility, while bubbles below show declining SES across generations. There’s also a slight concentration near the bottom of the plot, likely coming from students with low-SES backgrounds."

Again, we see a fairly strong positive correlation along the diagonal parity line. Interestingly, the majority of most schools lie below this line, indicating that high SES individuals experience some form of downward mobility compared to their parents. Perhaps, an individual has more autonomy to their social upwards mobility than previously observed or expected, which would also make sense. Notable schools, like the Veterans HS and Fatima HS have stayed in similar positions, meaning that some schools tend to experience similar movements. Nonetheless, the overall positive trend continues."

We again see a fairly strong trend upwards and so SES continues to influence children’s adjusted SES outcome. Notably, Veterans HS and Fatima HS remain in similar positions, suggesting that opportunities tend to stay in certain locations, with little change across these metrics."

        "value": "Shifting our focus to colleges, we examine Bias Own SES versus Bias Parent SES, where bias captures how economic connectedness within an SES group differs from the expected exposure to other SES groups. Here, positive bias means a college's SES networks are more isolated than expected, while negative bias indicates stronger-than-expected cross-SES integration. Most points cluster around the origin, suggesting that for most colleges, SES connectedness correlates closely with exposure for both students and parents. However, high-bias outliers, often community colleges with smaller enrollments towards the top right, show localized networks that may reinforce SES segmentation."

        "value": "Let’s compare that to the Bias High Own SES vs. Bias High Parent SES, where we see the pattern shifting significantly compared to previous visualizations. The majority of points are negative, and so for most colleges shown, high-SES students have lower economic connectedness within their SES group compared to what would be expected based on exposure. Thus, there’s a greater cross-SES integration for high-SES students overall, compared to a more neutral pattern for non-high-SES students. The outliers in the bottom left, mostly community colleges and technical schools, show institutions where high-SES networks are particularly weak relative to exposure. These schools often serve more diverse populations, possibly decreasing high-SES within-group connections. More generally, the slight negative trend along the diagonal suggests a relationship where higher bias in parental SES is associated with reduced bias in students' own SES. Larger schools cluster more tightly near the center, which makes sense as there’s less variation in SES-related bias. So, larger institutions may create environments that are more consistent in SES interaction making for less extremes of integration or isolation."

        "value": "Building on the previous analysis of SES networks, let’s now focus on different metrics of social connections: clustering, support ratio, and volunteering rate. These metrics give us insight into the cohesiveness of social networks within groups and the role of civic engagement. Clustering measures the average fraction of an individual's friend pairs who are also friends with each other, indicating the closeness of social circles. Support ratio gives the proportion of within-county friendships where the pair of friends share a third mutual friend within the same county as local social density. Volunteering rate gives the percentage of individuals participating in activities related to volunteering or activism as a measure of community involvement. Counties with high clustering tend to be small, with populations below 15,000. In these areas, close-knit social networks are naturally stronger, supported by nearly 100% support ratios. Similarly, counties with high volunteering rates also show nearly 100% support ratios, suggesting that strong local connections may encourage civic participation and community engagement."

We see that larger schools tend to have lower clustering (~30%) and very low volunteering rates, meaning that these social networks are less close and limited in terms of civic engagement. On the other hand, if we sort by high clustering values then we see that very small schools appear at the top (less than 100 students) where connections are more close and common. Interestingly, the highest volunteering rates also correlated with some of the higher clustering values, indicating that closer social networks may encourage greater civic engagement."

These colleges typically have relatively small cohort sizes, averaging around 500 students, and have moderate clustering levels ranging from low (around 30%) to high (up to 70%). However, there’s no strong patterns that emerge. Though, there seems to be a relationship between high support ratios and volunteering rates as the highest volunteering rates tend to have high support ratios and moderate-to-high clustering. This highlights the relationships between social structures and community involvement in smaller institutions, which we’ve seen shared amongst other groups across the data."

  "conclusion": [
    {
        "type": "text",
        "value": "Across the dataset, we've observed key trends linking social metrics to institutional and geographic characteristics. Smaller institutions and communities consistently showcase higher clustering and support ratios, indicating tightly-knit networks. Volunteering rates, while less consistent, tend to align with these cohesive structures, suggesting that strong local connections often encourage stronger civic participation. On the other hand, larger institutions and counties display less clustering and integration rates, likely due to their more diverse networks. These insights collectively highlight the role of community size and social integrations in defining both economic and civic mobilities."
