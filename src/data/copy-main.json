We know a lot of you will disagree with our method, so we made <a href=https://pudding.cool>a sandbox</a> that explains our choices, and lets you customize and share your own. Creating a data set of colloquially used places in the US is a mammoth task, so we are updating it as we learn more.

Scores are split into three tiers; 75+ means it has a strong connection <strong>(probably)</strong>, 50+ is less strong <strong>(maybe)</strong>, and  50 is a weak connection <strong>(toss-up).</strong>","placeNote":"A county counts towards a place if that place was the highest scoring in that county."}
